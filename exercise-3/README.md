# Exercise-3

As described in the [git-basics
chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin
by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if
you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal
command you've learned thus far in the class (or elsewhere ;-).  In particular, you
should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command

An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)

A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)


# cp

The `cp` command can be used to _copy_ a file or folder. For example:

`cp my-photo.png my photo2.png`

Here's some more information about the `cp` command:

- It can be used to _recursively_ copy a directory with the `-R` option: `cp -R folder-1 folder-2`

  - recursive behavior can also be involked by `r` or `--recuesive` option

- You can print out progress to the terminal using the `-v` command, making it _verbose_ : `cp -R -v folder-1 folder-2`

See `complete` branch for answers.
